    		<h3>Introduction</h3>
    		<p>The purpose of this form is to provide you with information that may affect your decision as to whether or not to participate in this research study. If you decide to participate in this study, this form will also be used to record your consent.</p>
    		<p>You have been asked to participate in a research project that investigates computer commodity devices data patterns while performing tasks in the computer. The goal of the study is to determine whether peripheralâ€™s data can be used to model user behavior while interacting with the computer.</p>

  		<section id="sec-tasks">
    		<h3>What you will be asked to do</h3>
    		<p>By agreeing to take part in this study, you will be asked to perform simple tasks that individually should take no longer than 5 minutes to complete. The complete study should take no longer than 40 minutes.</p>
    		<p>In case you accept to be part of this study, you will first be asked to fill in a questionnaire about your affective state and computer usage. In fact, you will asked to report your affective state and work load after you finish each task. You will then will be guided to the first task, where you will perform a sorting task. In this task, you will be asked to double-click images to open them, read the instructions, and drag and drop each image into the correct folder. Each image will contain a written color name painted with an ink that does not necessarily match the color name. The instructions will inform whether you should drag the image into the folder corresponding to the color name or font color. The image below shows two examples with different instructions each.</p>
    		<img class="centered-img" src="resources/cwtExample.png"/>
    		<p>Once you finish the sorting task, you will perform a typing task. In this task, you will be shown an painting/picture and will be asked to write about it. You can describe the elements of the picture, such as who is in it, how are their cloths, what they are doing, and are also encouraged to come up with a story about that picture. Keep in mind that you must use the full 5 minutes to perform this task - in case you finish it in less than 5 minutes a window will appear asking you to keep writing. An example of a painting and a composition about is shown below:</p>
    		<img class="centered-img" src="resources/typingExample.png"/>
    		<p>Next, you will be asked to watch a short video with images of the nature. Once you finish the video, you will again play the same sorting task as described earlier, but in a different modality. Finally, you will perform again the same typing task you performed earlier.</p>
